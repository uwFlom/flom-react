  "intro" : "There are a number of regions that people talk about in the United States. We're interested in where you believe some of these regions are. We are going to ask you to draw a few (4) of these regions on a map to help us understand where you believe these areas are. There are no right or wrong answers; we are interested in specifically you think these areas are. We will then ask you to listen to a few (3) samples of speech from these different regions and answer two quick questions about each. We anticipate that this should only take you at most a few (between 5 and 10) minutes.",
